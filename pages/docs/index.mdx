# ABR Brush Viewer/Exporter

## What is it?

An online tool to view and export brush images from .abr files.
No installation necessary and parsing and export happens entirely in your browser.

Some caveats: very old .abr files are not supported. So far the limited collections of brush files I've
tested have worked, but there may be ones that can't be parsed for some reason.

Only the brush "sample" images are exported. Currently this does not extract any brush parameters like jitter,
radius, etc.

## What's the output?

Grayscale PNG images intended to be used as alpha masks. Black represents full transparency and white
represents full opacity. The images themselves don't have transparency.

You can use "save as" to download individual images, or the export button to download all of them to a zip.

## How do I use alpha masks in Blender for texture painting?

More detailed explanation and screenshots to be added later, but roughly:

1. Create a new brush
2. Under **Brush Settings > Texture** click the **+ New** button
3. Next to the newly created texture name, click on the rightmost button that looks like two toggle sliders
4. You should now be on the Texture tab (red checkerbox icon). Under **Image** > **Settings** click the Open button
5. Select your brush image in the file browser
6. Expand the **Alpha** section and make sure **Calculate** is checked
7. You can now go back to the brush settings and adjust the mapping type, stroke, etc.

You can also use addons like BPainter or PBR Painter make this workflow quicker.

## How do I use alpha masks in ArmorPaint?

Under brushes, click import and select your brush PNG.

## Help, I encountered a bug or a .abr file that couldn't be parsed

File a ticket on the [project issue tracker](https://github.com/jlai/brush-viewer/issues/new). Include the error message,
if any, and your browser/OS. Mention if the issue occurs for specific abr files or for your browser in general.

Do not attach any .abr files unless you created them yourself. If it's freely available online (or reasonably cheap),
mention where you can download it from rather than attaching the file.
